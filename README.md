### üè† [Homepage](https://github.com/yourusername/SRGAN-Custom-Dataset)

## Introduction

Welcome to the SRGAN project! This repository contains code and instructions for training a Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) on a custom dataset. SRGAN is a powerful neural network architecture that can upscale low-resolution images to high-resolution images with impressive detail and fidelity.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Custom Dataset Support:** Train SRGAN on your custom dataset to achieve the best results for your specific use case.
- **Flexible Environment:** Easily set up and configure the environment using Anaconda and PyTorch.
- **GPU & CPU Support:** Train and test your model on both GPU and CPU hardware, depending on your resources.
- **Simple Training & Testing:** Straightforward commands for training and testing the SRGAN model.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following prerequisites before proceeding with the installation:

- Anaconda
- Python 3.7+
- Conda

## üì¶ Environment Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SRGAN-Custom-Dataset.git
   cd SRGAN-Custom-Dataset

2. **Set up the environment:**

Open the Anaconda prompt and navigate to the folder where you have your environment.yml file:
```sh
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate srganenv_gpu
